        with:
          file-path: 'data/issues.json'
          file-format: json
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          dry-run: true

  import-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Import Issues
        uses: dsanchezcr/issue-importer-action@v1

          file-path: 'data/issues.json'
          file-format: json
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Input Formats

### CSV Format

Your CSV file should have the following columns (title is required, others are optional):

```csv
title,body,labels,assignees,milestone
"Bug: App crashes on startup","The application crashes when...",bug;critical,username1;username2,v1.0
"Feature: Add dark mode","Users have requested...",enhancement,username1,v2.0
```

**CSV Column Details:**
- `title` (required): Issue title
- `body` or `description`: Issue description/body
- `labels`: Comma or semicolon-separated list of labels
- `assignees`: Comma or semicolon-separated list of GitHub usernames
- `milestone`: Milestone name

### JSON Format

#### Array Format
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Bug: App crashes on startup",
    "body": "The application crashes when users try to start it...",
    "labels": ["bug", "critical"],
    "assignees": ["username1", "username2"],
    "milestone": "v1.0"
  },
  {
    "title": "Feature: Add dark mode",
    "description": "Users have requested a dark mode option...",
    "labels": "enhancement",
    "assignees": "username1",
    "milestone": "v2.0"
  }
]
```

#### Object Format
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "title": "Bug: App crashes on startup",
      "body": "The application crashes when users try to start it...",
      "labels": ["bug", "critical"],
      "assignees": ["username1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**JSON Field Details:**
- `title` (required): Issue title
- `body` or `description`: Issue description
- `labels`: Array of strings or comma-separated string
- `assignees`: Array of GitHub usernames or comma-separated string
- `milestone`: Milestone name

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `file-path` | Path to the CSV or JSON file containing issues | Yes | - |
| `file-format` | Format of the input file (`csv` or `json`) | Yes | `csv` |
| `github-token` | GitHub token with repository write permissions | Yes | - |
| `dry-run` | Perform a dry run without creating actual issues | No | `false` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `issues-created` | Number of issues successfully created |
| `issues-failed` | Number of issues that failed to create |
| `summary` | Summary of the import operation |

## Permissions

The GitHub token used must have the following permissions:
- `issues: write` - To create issues
- `metadata: read` - To read repository metadata

For organization repositories, ensure the token has appropriate access to the target repository.

## Error Handling

The action includes comprehensive error handling:

- **File Validation**: Checks if the input file exists and is readable
- **Format Validation**: Validates CSV/JSON structure and content
- **Data Validation**: Ensures required fields (title) are present
- **API Error Handling**: Gracefully handles GitHub API errors
- **Partial Failures**: Continues processing remaining issues if some fail

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Milestone Not Found Error
```
Warning: Milestone "v1.0" not found in repository. Issue will be created without milestone.
```

**Solution**: Create the milestone in your repository first, or remove/update the milestone reference in your data file.

#### 2. Invalid Assignees Error
```
Error: Validation Failed: {"value":"alice;bob","resource":"Issue","field":"assignees","code":"invalid"}
```

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Invalid usernames**: Replace placeholder usernames like "alice", "bob" with actual GitHub usernames of repository collaborators
- **Non-collaborators**: Ensure all assignees are collaborators on the repository
- **Separator issues**: The action now supports both comma (`,`) and semicolon (`;`) separators for CSV files

**Example fix**:
```csv
# Before (incorrect)
"Setup CI/CD Pipeline","Description","enhancement","alice;bob","v1.0"

# After (correct)
"Setup CI/CD Pipeline","Description","enhancement","","v1.0"
```

#### 3. Permission Errors
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

**Solution**: Ensure your GitHub token has the required permissions:
- `issues: write`
- `metadata: read`

#### 4. CSV Parsing Issues

If you're having trouble with CSV files:
- Ensure proper quoting of fields containing commas or newlines
- Use either commas or semicolons consistently for separating multiple values
- Check for encoding issues (use UTF-8)

#### 5. Rate Limiting

If you're importing many issues:
- The action includes automatic delays between requests
- Consider running with `dry-run: true` first to validate your data
- For very large imports, consider splitting into smaller batches

### Validation Tips

1. **Always test with dry-run first**:
   ```yaml
   with:
     dry-run: true
   ```

2. **Validate assignee usernames**: Ensure all usernames exist and are collaborators

3. **Check milestone names**: Verify milestones exist in your repository

4. **Use corrected examples**: Check the `examples/sample-issues.csv` and `examples/sample-issues.json` files for proper formatting

## Examples

### Example CSV File

```csv
title,body,labels,assignees
"Setup CI/CD Pipeline","We need to setup automated testing and deployment","enhancement;devops",""
"Fix login bug","Users can't login with special characters in password","bug;high-priority",""
"Update documentation","API documentation needs updating","documentation",""
```

### Example JSON File

```json
{
  "issues": [    {
      "title": "Setup CI/CD Pipeline",
      "body": "We need to setup automated testing and deployment",
      "labels": ["enhancement", "devops"],
      "assignees": []
    },
    {
      "title": "Fix login bug",
      "body": "Users can't login with special characters in password",
      "labels": ["bug", "high-priority"],
      "assignees": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the action
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Building for Distribution

The action uses `@vercel/ncc` to compile all dependencies into a single file:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates `dist/index.js` which must be committed to the repository for GitHub Actions to execute.
